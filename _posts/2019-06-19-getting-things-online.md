This is the first blog post on my website. This is a new experience.

Welcome to my website and thanks for reading this blog post. I hope to entertain you with
various blog posts to come. Learning a new code language to work with this has been fun
so far and I'm glad I got the chance to do this!

Enough of me babbling. Lets discuss the pain of getting this online.

The website was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which thankfully is native
in Github Pages. Configuring it is straightforward and easy enough. It seems to build
similarly to JavaScript which is my native code language. So it wasn't a struggle other 
than just learning the formatting.

Thats enough of me spouting off. Thanks for reading.
